A small intro to primitive types

'''
In Python3 ints are unbouned - so the maximum integer representable
is a function of the available memory
'''

# The constant sys.maxsize can be used to find the word-size specifically
# it is the max value integer that be stored in the word
import sys
print("Max word size (ints): sys.maxsize: ", sys.maxsize)
print("Max word size (floats): sys.float_into: ", sys.float_info)
